# Household Food Consumption During Covid-19 :basket:
Was there a statistically significant change in UK household food consumption during the Covid-19 pandemic? (2019/20)

## Background
This is my mid-bootcamp personal project. The covid lockdowns changed a lot in the food industry including household food consumption. 
This project investigates whether people were actually purchasing more at home versus previous years and breaks down various food categories.


## Objective
* Clean the dataset
* Build interactive dashboards to explore the data over time
* Apply the statistical techniques (Shapiro Wilk and two sample tests) to derive conclusions


## Technical skills used

* Python
* Tableau
* Statistical Sample Testing: a) Shapiro Wilk b) Two-tailed Sample Test 


## Data source
UK Government Family Food datasets - one of few publicly available data collected over period of time.

## Repository Contents
1. data-files - contains all the datasets used or created in this project
2. functions.py - contains importable python functions for data cleaning and statistical tests
3. notebooks - a) ```cleaning-consumption-data.ipynb ``` and b)  ```hypotheis-testing.ipynb ```

## Conclusions

1. Most primary food categories did not change significantly e.g. meat. Some households will have massively increased (reduced restaurant and takeaway) and some reduced size of basket (increased costs) so perhaps why most food demand balance out?

2. Statistically significant changes in some categories especially soft drinks, flour and "other food and drinks". 
Appears to be more treats, snacks (carbs) into the house, as well as tea and coffee - perhaps due to rapid shift towards work from home culture. 

3. Limitations to the survery data:
* Most people do not keep hold of our receipts in this day and age restricts accurate records
* Sample size = average of 5,000 households each year (is it representative - 1-2% of the total number of UK households)

4. Topic can be researched further by finding data on expenditure, nutritional content, or/and segment population by household income.
