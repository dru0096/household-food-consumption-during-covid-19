# Household Food Consumption During Covid-19 
Was there a statistically significant change in UK household food consumption during the Covid-19 pandemic? (2019/20)

## Background

This project investigates whether people were actually purchasing more at home versus previous years and breaks down various food categories.


## Objective
* Clean the dataset
* Build interactive dashboards to explore the data over time
* Apply the statistical techniques (Shapiro Wilk and two sample tests) to derive conclusions


## Technical skills used
